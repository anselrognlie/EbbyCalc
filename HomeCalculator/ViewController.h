  `ViewController` is the main `UIViewController` class for the app.

  Handles notifications that the contents of the numeric display should be copied.

  @param text The text contents of the numeric display. Note that we will actually ignore this value and just take the undecorated numeric value directly.

  @return The text that should be placed on the clipboard.  We will return a generically serialized version of the calculator display contents, rather than the decorated display content.
