About Home Calculator
=====================

Home Calculator is a simple calculator app primarily targetting the iPad since it does not ship with a native calculator app. I was frustrated that other iPad calculators were ad-supported or pay, so I decided to write my own. I wanted it to resemble the style of the iPhone native app, while supporting the set of operations that the physical calculator I normally used for household expense tracking provided, most importantly a stored tax calculation (for sales tax) and the particular behavior of the sign key combined with chained operations.

This is not a scientific calculator, nor an engineering calculator, and I don't expect it will ever become one.  It does properly use decimal-based number types to avoid floating point rounding errors, and provides 16-digits of display precision, which is more than enough for my needs.

The regular view of the calculator follows the layout of the aforementioned physical calculator, as that's where I'm used to the buttons being, but the layout does get rearranged for very narrow layouts, such as during Split View or Slide Over scenarios.

This app is available for installation in the App Store.  Please file any bug or feature requests on github.com, though not guaratees are given regarding response or timeliness.  But feel free to make your own fork!
